# Metal_Learn
This project realizes the rendering of real-time video stream through Metal, and the rendered video stream supports NV12, NV21, RGB, BGR and other video formatsï¼ŒAlthough the Metal rendering of this project only shows the rendering of the camera on the Mac platform, the iOS platform is also supported.

## Ideas
In order to be compatible with many video frame formats, in CVTI420Buffer, I will convert YUV420, RGB and other data formats to I420 through the newI420Frame and toI420 methods, and then render the Y, U, V planes in Metal. This example is rendered by collecting data from a Mac computer camera.

## Usage
The specific usage of tmalview is as follows:

    if ([CVTMetalView isMetalAvailable]) {

         CGFloat height = self. view. frame. size. width * 9 / 16.0;

         self. metalView = [[CVTMetalView alloc] initWithFrame:NSMakeRect(0, 0, self.view.frame.size.width, height)];

         self. metalView. delegate = self;

         self. metalView. wantsLayer = YES;

         self. metalView. layer. backgroundColor = [NSColor blackColor]. CGColor;

         [self.view addSubview:self.metalView];

     }
